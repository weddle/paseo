# Claude Code

Paseo runs Claude Code through the official `claude` CLI using the Claude Agent SDK.

## Does Claude Code cost extra in Paseo?

No. Claude Code usage in Paseo counts against your normal Claude plan limits. It does not require a separate pool of Agent SDK credits.

You still need a Claude plan that includes Claude Code, and your plan's usual usage limits apply.

## Getting started

Install and sign in to the Claude Code CLI on the machine running Paseo. Paseo uses that existing installation and account when you start a Claude Code agent.

If your Claude login expires, re-authenticate with the Claude Code CLI, then start a new Claude Code session in Paseo. Existing Paseo sessions keep the authentication they started with, so re-authenticating does not update a session that is already running.

## Use Claude Code in the Paseo terminal

Claude Code also works great inside the Paseo terminal. If you prefer the standard CLI experience, open a terminal in your workspace and run `claude` as usual.

You can use the terminal from Paseo's desktop, web, or mobile app while keeping access to your workspace, git changes, and other Paseo tools.
